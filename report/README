Document data should be put into data/documents directory, queries and relevance data should be put in data/ directory.
The project structure looks like this

/root/path/of/program
|-- data
|   |-- documents
|   |   |-- documents.zip
|   |-- questions-descriptions.txt
|   |-- relevance-judgements.csv
|   |-- test-questions.txt
|-- lib
|-- src
|-- pom.xml

We run our program in IntelliJ with Maven. The result is printed out to standard output and can be redirected to any files.
